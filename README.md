# PROS UI Software Engineer Pre-Interview Questions

The repo includes a set of tests that assess your JavaScript skills, based
on Rebecca Murphey's js-assessment framework.

# For Interviewees

## How do I begin?

1. If you don't have a Github account, [sign up](https://github.com/signup/free)!
2. Fork this repo to your own Github repo
3. Clone the repo locally on your own computer
4. Implement the functions in each of the scripts located in the `app/` dir
5. Test your results as described below
6. Commit your changes to your personal Github repo (No need to submit a pull request)
7. Email us the link to your repo so that we can review your results

Note: You may receive notifications that your repo has been followed or forked by a PROS employee.
These actions are simply part of the review process.

## I want to work on the tests; what do I do?

To use the tests, you will need to install Node -- you can do this via the
[download page](http://nodejs.org/#download) or using
[Homebrew](http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/) if you are on a Mac.

Note that on Windows, there are some reports that you will need to restart
after installing Node - see #12. Also, you may need to alter package.json, namely change:
```    "test": "mocha -R spec 'tests/app'",```
to
```    "test": "mocha -R spec tests\\app",```. This may apply to the other npm scripts as well.

You can clone or download this repo. Once you have done so, from the root
directory of the repo, run:

    npm install
    node bin/serve

You can then view the tests in your browser at
[http://localhost:4444](http://localhost:4444).

When you visit that page, all of the tests should be failing; your job is to
get the tests to pass. To do this, you'll need to refer to the tests in the
files in the `tests/app` directory, and edit the files in the `app/` directory.
Once you update a test, you can reload the test page in the browser to see
whether it worked.

You can also run (most of) the tests on the command line:

    npm test

The command line runner is a work in progress; contributions welcome :)

## I need help!

There may be friendly folks willing to help you in \#js-assessment or
\#jshotline on freenode IRC.

# For PROS Employees

## I want to contribute tests; what do I do?

Submit a pull request! The tests are currently loosely organized by topic, so
you should do your best to add tests to the appropriate file in `tests/app`, or
create a new file there if you don't see an appropriate one. If you do create
a new file, make sure to add it to `tests/runner.js`, and to add a stub for the
solution to the corresponding file in `app/`. Finally, it would be great if you
could update the [answers](https://github.com/rmurphey/js-assessment-answers)
as well.

Any substantial contributions will be duly credited in the readme, as well as
of course in the git commit log.

### Data-driven tests

If your tests need data that can be fetched via XHR, stick a `.json` file in
the `data` directory; you can access it at `/data/<filename>.json`.

### Available dependencies

The repo includes jQuery, Backbone, Underscore, and RequireJS. If there's other
stuff you'd find useful, you can put it in the `lib` directory.

## I want to see the answers!

First, bear in mind that looking up the answers is going to teach you a whole
lot less than you'll learn by working on the tests, even if you occasionally get
stuck. I'd recommend only looking at the answers once you have the tests
passing, to see if there's another way you could have approached the
problem. When you're ready to look at the answers, you can find them
[here](https://github.com/rmurphey/js-assessment-answers); I'll do my best to
keep them up to date.

## I hate \<some technology you've chosen\>

This repo uses [RequireJS](http://requirejs.org) for dependency management and
[Mocha](http://visionmedia.github.com/mocha/) and [expect.js](https://github.com/LearnBoost/expect.js/blob/master/README.md)
for the tests themselves. It uses the BDD style for authoring tests. If this
doesn't suit you, please fork away, or, better, submit a pull request that lets
this be more flexible than it currently is.
